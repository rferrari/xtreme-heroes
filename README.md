## 🖥️ About the App

This is a **Top Trumps card game**, inspired by [JohnPetros' Tekken Top Trumps Game](https://github.com/JohnPetros/tekken-top-trumps-game). The project has evolved to include new features and design by the **Skatehive Dev Team**, focusing on improved gameplay, animations, and customizations.

## 🕹️ About the Game

- Players: User (Player One) vs Bot (Player Two).
- Players choose 10 fighters each from a shared deck.
- Each fighter has attributes: `Style`, `Agility`, and `Speed`.
- Players take turns selecting an attribute to compare, and the fighter with the higher value wins the round.
- The losing player's fighter is transferred to the winner's deck.
- The game continues until one player wins all fighters.

---

## ✨ Features

- Smooth animation feedback on all user actions 💫.
- Contextual gameplay feedback, blocking actions when necessary.
- Card design reflects each player's ownership.
- AI-driven actions for Player Two.
- Dynamic modals display results after each round and at the game's conclusion.
