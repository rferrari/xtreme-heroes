## 🖥️ About the App

This is a **Skaters Top Trumps Card Game**, inspired by [JohnPetros' Tekken Top Trumps Game](https://github.com/JohnPetros/tekken-top-trumps-game). The project has evolved to include new features and design by the **Skatehive Dev Team**, focusing on improved gameplay, animations, and customizations.

## 🕹️ About the Game

- Players: User (Player One) vs Bot (Player Two).
- Players choose 10 skaters each from a shared deck.
- Each skater has attributes: `Style`, `Agility`, and `Speed`.
- Players take turns selecting an attribute to compare, and the skater with the higher value wins the round.
- The losing player's skater is transferred to the winner's deck.
- The game continues until one player wins all skaters.

---

## ✨ Features

- Smooth animation feedback on all user actions.
- Contextual gameplay feedback, blocking actions when necessary.
- Card design reflects each player's ownership.
- AI-driven actions for Player Two.
- Dynamic modals display results after each round and at the game's conclusion.
- Now we have [Hive Wallet](https://hive.io/) Connection Web3 using [Aioha](https://github.com/aioha-hive/aioha).
- Animated Loading and Login Page
- Post results on the [🛹 Skatehive community](https://skatehive.app/) on the Hive Blockchain
